- Calulate LPS(longest prefix suffix) array that contains longest prefix that is also a suffix.
- This can be done in O(n) using KMP algorithm (prefix array creation part only).
- Once the LPS array is created, suppose "len" is the length of longest prefix which is also a suffix and "n" is the length of string.
- if "n-len" devides n (i.e., n % (n-len) == 0) then return True else return False.
